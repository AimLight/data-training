# NYT Data Training Materials
Materials from the NYT data training program, available for public use. 

For some background on what is in these files, please read the blog post [here](https://open.nytimes.com/how-we-helped-our-reporters-learn-to-love-spreadsheets-adc43a93b919).

We recommend you view these files through [Google Drive here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZS57_40tWuIB7tV4APVMmTZ-5PXDwX9w?usp=sharing) The activites and cheat sheets all follow Google Sheets. 

We're providing the materials on Github as well because of requests to translate the materials. If you'd like to translate these materials, please fork the repo (in the top right), which will create a copy in your own account. Create a new folder with materials for your language. You can view files in your own account through [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or download them to your computer and then upload again into your new language folder. When you are done, come back to this page to submit a pull request so we can integrate your changes. You may also find it helpful to refer to this overview of the [Github workflow.](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
